In this project, we were given 15 reference research papers out of which 10 research papers were publishable and 5 were not publishable and 135 sample research papers.
The conferences of the 15 research papers were also given.  
So now, we have to prepare an AI Automated system which basically predicts the publishability of 135 sample research papers and if publishable, predict their conference out of 5 conferences which are KDD,CVPR,EMNLP,NeurIPS,TMLR.
KDD: The ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is one of the premier international forums for advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present cutting-edge innovations in data mining theory and real-world applications. KDD is known for its high-impact research, rigorous peer review, and influential contributions to the global AI community.
TMLR: Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal focused on publishing high-quality research in all areas of machine learning. It was established by members of the machine learning community to provide a fast, transparent, and community-driven alternative to traditional publication venues.
CVPR: CVPR stands for the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. It is one of the top-tier international conferences in computer vision, co-sponsored by IEEE and CVF (Computer Vision Foundation).Focuses on cutting-edge research in computer vision, deep learning, image and video analysis, 3D vision, generative models, visual recognition, and more.
EMNLP: EMNLP stands for the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. It is one of the top conferences in Natural Language Processing (NLP), organized by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) through its SIGDAT special interest group. Focuses on empirical and data-driven approaches to NLP.Covers areas like language modeling, machine translation, question answering, dialog systems, LLMs, ethics in NLP, and more.
NeurIPS: NeurIPS, or the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, is one of the most prestigious and influential conferences in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Established in 1987, it serves as a global platform for presenting cutting-edge research in areas such as deep learning, optimization, probabilistic models, neuroscience, and responsible AI. Known for its rigorous peer-review process and high standards, NeurIPS attracts top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry. The conference features a rich program that includes paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, and competitions, offering a blend of theoretical advances and real-world applications. NeurIPS has played a key role in shaping the development of modern AI and continues to be a premier venue for the latest innovations in the field.


THE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM : so here i designed the solution of this problem without using docker and pathway
So I created a multi agent architecture using langgraph and langchain.
It had 2 agents. the first agent provided the scores for 8 important features of a research paper. They are methodology, ethics, clarity, factual_correctness, rigorousity, novelty, results and technical_soundness. The second one predicted the conference of the research paper.  
The first agent had the following functions : 'initial_analysis' function which basically analyze the research paper and generate important queries and we have integrated TavilyAPI along with the llm in the function which basically searches for similar documents for each query.
'process_results' stores the result and 'final_score' basically predict the scores after comparing the information from tavily and the sample research papers. 
The second agent had 'retrieve_step' function which basically did the semantic similarity searches for the 135 sample research papers using a faiss vector_store
which basically has 10 publishable refernce research papers. 'result_fetching' function is a more advanced way infact the most phenomenal way to judge the conference of the paper. it basically the arxiv results of the research paper . extract the url, category to which the research paper belong, the abstract, the title.it also performs the semantic similarity searches with the research paper using fundamental nlp techniques like tf-idf vectorizer. llms function finally predict the conference using all the information.
so first of all put the 15 research papers in the first agent . whatever the score comes, parse it and put it in a randomforest classifier for predicting publishability. Now put 135 research papers in the first agent and the random forest to predict the publishability . 
those sample are publishable put them in the second agent to predict conference.
